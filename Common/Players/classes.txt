King bob - 5/8/2025 - "ykw would be cool? having the black market machine spawn in the caves somewhere that has good loot only openable after hardmode"

King bob - 6/8/2025 - "i was also thinking. what if you made some generic weapons that can be dropped from normal enemies at very low drop rates. like 3-4 pre hardmode and hardmode weapons. was just a thought i had this morning"

Add custom sound effects

Add exodus items
