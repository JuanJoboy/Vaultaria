-- INTRODUCTION --

Greetings Minion, it is I, your Master CL4P-TP. You've been a good minion to me all these years but I think it's time for you to finally venture of on your own. And I've found the perfect planet for you to start your solo journey, the land of Terraria. They say the planet is ravaged by spirits and that some lunatic cult members are trying to awaken an old god. Sounds familiar... anyways Minion, get out there and show those psychos what a badass Vault Hunter trained by the mighty CL4P-TP can do. 

-- MOD INFORMATION --

This mod is a simple Borderlands mod that I decided to make because I am a huge fan of the franchise and I just wanted to import all of the unique and cool aspects over to Terraria. There are currently 56 new items in this mod (with more on the way) as well as new prefixes to give your items. Some prefixes may not be great on some weapons and in general I'm open to any feedback you guys may have.

The mod is designed to be played in Expert or Master mode because that's what I scaled the weapons for; and every item was designed with progression in mind. So every boss drops something, and items can be crafted during various stages of the game.

-- CONSIDERATIONS --

Q: What mods are compatible?
A: Any mod should work fine as no changes are being made to mobs, bosses or world generation.

Q: Are you associated with Terralands: Project Vaulthalla?
A: No, I am not associated with them, that is a separate Borderlands mod that does its own thing. Although both our mods can be run at the same time, I designed this mod to be standalone.

Q: What mods do you recommend?
A: I heavily recommend that you play with Quite Enough Recipes, as it allows you to see how every item can be obtained. It shows item recipes and if an enemy drops an item, it'll show the drop sources as well as the drop rates. Recipe Viewer is also good as you can see the full recipe tree of an item.

Q: Where can I submit feedback?
A: As of now, there is no Discord so the comment section on the steam page would be the best place.

Q: Who worked on this mod?
A: I'm the sole developer.
