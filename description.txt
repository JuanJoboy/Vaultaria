-- INTRODUCTION --

Greetings Minion, it is I, your glorious Master CL4P-TP. You've been a loyal squire for far too long, and I think it's finally time for you to set out on an adventure of your own. And guess what? I've found the perfect planet for you: Terraria.
Word on the ECHOnet is that it's crawling with weird monsters and some lunatic cult members trying to wake up an ancient god. Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so. Anyways, get out there and show those psychos what a badass Vault Hunter trained by yours truly can do.

-- MOD INFORMATION --

This is a simple Borderlands mod that I decided to make because I'm a huge fan of the franchise and I just wanted to import all of the unique and cool aspects over to Terraria. There are currently 200+ new items (with every weapon having it's respective Borderlands audio) in this mod (with more on the way) plus new prefixes to shake up how your gear behaves. Some prefixes might not work great on certain weapons, but hey, experimentation is part of the fun.

This mod is designed to be played in either Expert or Master mode as that's what the items are scaled for. Each item has also been scaled to naturally fit into Terraria's progression, with every boss dropping something unique. And if you feel as though the game is too easy, then go into the config and bump up the Vault Hunter Mode to either 2 (TVHM) or 3 (UVHM). There are also 6 other config settings to tune the mod to something right for you.

Some other new things in this mod include Claptrap, a helpful Town NPC available at the start of the game. He provides many different items at both the start of Pre Hardmode and Hardmode and also gives a lot of useful information in regards to mechanics within the mod. Mobs also have a rare chance to be either a Chubby (Pre-Hardmode) or a Tubby (Hardmode). These mobs drop rare items, so be on the lookout for them. And if you can't be bothered farming tubbies, then scour the land and find Vault Fragments to make 2 Vault Keys. With these keys you'll be able to go inside the 2 Vaults in the world and farm the items via a Boss Rush.

And this is just the beginning - I plan to keep expanding with more weapons, mechanics, polish, and mayhem. Feedback, bug reports, and wild weapon ideas are always welcome!

-- CONSIDERATIONS --

Q: What mods are compatible?
A: Most mods should be compatible, only 2 are incompatible as far as I'm aware: Secrets of the Shadow & Starlight River. The world generation for the structure in the Underworld for SOTS gets mixed in with the Vault placed there, and in my testing with SR, the world simply can't be generated.

Q: Are you associated with Terralands: Project Vaulthalla?
A: Nope, while we are both Borderlands mods, Vaultaria is a totally separate experience and is designed to stand on its own.

Q: What mods do you recommend?
A: Quite Enough Recipes - For full recipe and drop info
   Recipe Viewer - Great for seeing full crafting trees
   Loot Beams - Adds the Borderlands loot beam effect
   Any content mod you enjoy (Calamity, Fargo's, etc.)

Q: Will you ever add modded Borderlands content?
A: Yep, so far this mod has gotten approval to use any item from Exodus. In fact 3 weapons are already available.

Q: Where can I submit feedback?
A: The steam workshop page would be the best place.

-- FINAL WORD --

That's all for now Minion. I'll be watching you from a distance (and laughing at your failures).
Now get out there and cause some mayhem, Vault Hunter...
